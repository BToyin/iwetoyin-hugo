Hello hello, and welcome back my peopledem. I am back…again. If you are a first time reader then welcome to my humble abode! But if you have been following me on Instagram or Facebook (blast from the past I know) then you might be aware that I’ve started and restarted and renamed this blog of mine a few times. It’s gone through a few transitions in the last few years, but we are back again and here to stay for a while. Anyways, let me not do too much pre-amble and just jump straight into that goodness. I hope you enjoy this post, and let me know what you think, always appreciate some feedback and engagement.

In this blog post I’m talking about why I think the starting a Youtube channel (or a blog or something similar) is super beneficial and can have positive effects for your life. Essentially, what I’m referring to here is having some kind of channel through which you can express the things that are going on in your life, thoughts you have in your mind and/or just generally sharing your knowledge on certain topics. 

To provide context I have recently started a [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@ToyinTheDev/featured) channel (and also restarted this blog) and though I have been very inconsistent with posting videos on the channel, because imposter syndrome and excuses and all that, I’ve realised that there’s been some positive effects I’ve already seen in my life by simply thinking about creating Youtube content for the last couple months. 

Firstly, and probably the most obvious benefit, talking in front of (or behind) a camera forces you to consider how you communicate. There’s very few reasons that you will record yourself talking for extended periods. This is a shame really because I’m sure there’s many studies out there that will corroborate the fact that recording yourself and watching it back is a great way to identify and implement ways to improve…basically anything, but in this case, how you communicate. You won’t get those studies here so don’t hold your breath…I come with opinions not facts. But still, since you are a regular degular person and probably don’t record yourself, you are missing out on a great way to improve on a skill that is vital in so many areas of life. Whether it’s improving personal or romantic relationships, making progress at work or becoming better at debating, we could all benefit by improving the way in which we communicate. 

How quickly do you talk? How much do you waffle before getting to the point? How many times do you say “umm” whilst speaking? These aren’t questions we ask ourselves unless we’re doing presentations at uni or work. But why do we think these things matter less in our everyday lives? Not suggesting saying “umm” should be taboo, but if you were to just slow down whilst speaking you could probably win that next argument with your significant other because you might not be stumbling over your words like a numpty. 

Now the solution I present to you… start a Youtube channel. You have to record yourself and unless you are a different breed of animal, you will be watching back that video before posting it on Youtube. Unless you take videos in 1-take, you’ll be editing videos, cutting out parts that you redid, stumbled on, forgot what you were saying etc. The process of taking a Youtube video, editing it and then uploading it will naturally lend itself to you being forced to hearing yourself speak. Obviously this depends on the type of content you choose to make, but if you are speaking and listening to yourself speak, you will gleam the benefit of hearing yourself speak and will definitely improve the way you communicate, just through simple awareness. 

I have always been a mumbler. Pretty sure it runs in the family because my brothers also mumble. In the wise words of my wife, “Emphasise your worddssss-a”. So this isn’t new information. But it really hits different when you have to retake a section of a Youtube video you’re making because no one can f****** hear you. This clearly won’t improve straight away because I’ve been speaking a certain way for a while, but this awareness (and embarrassment of putting our sh*t content) will sway me in the right direction. I’m a pretty confident speaker and view my communication as one of my best assets, especially at work. But I’ve realised that I’m not actually a great story teller. I value getting to the point too much. And whilst that’s great skill to have at work (because I hate nothing more than wafflers at work), it’s not so great when you’re trying to tell a funny story or an anecdote that will capture people. So one of my aims in creating Youtube content is to improve that side of my communications skills and tell better stories. 

There’s lots of other tenants of communication to explore and everyone has a different area that they can and need to improve on. But you’ll never really know without watching or hearing yourself speak. Maybe you speak like a dead mouse with no animation…or maybe there’s too much hand movement going on and it looks like you’re scrapping AJ. Either way, communication is key. So start a Youtube channel and record yourself speaking and see your communication skills flourish. Anyways, that’s it folks… short and snappy for the first one back. I hope you enjoyed, and if you did, or didn’t go and subscribe to my Youtube channel and like my videos and all of that good stuff. It was just a thought I had

Peace and blessings
