Hello and welcome to Ìwé Toyin! If you don't already know, the handsome man in the pictures is me - the aforementioned Toyin (or Bait to some). So, just a little introduction. I'm a German-born, Nigerian, living in Birmingham and working as a Senior Software Engineer. Ìwé Toyin very loosely translates to Book of Toyin in Yoruba and that's what this blog is. It's a collection of my thoughts and feelings in written format. Expect to find a chaotic but entertaining blog, semi-useful resources I put together and some shameless self-promotion. Thanks for reading this far and enjoy!
